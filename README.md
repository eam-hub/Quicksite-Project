# Visualization With Quicksite
My first project is analyzing data in an S3 by creating dashboards with Amazon Quicksite.
This project was done with the assistance of @techwithlucy youtube page

Quicksight provide us with interactive visualizations and dashboards that we can use to analyze data stored in the cloud. In this project I downloaded a dataset of the 50,000 top selling Amazon products and stored them in an S3 bucket. I then created a Quciksite account and connected the S3 to Quicksite. Quicksite then provided me with a dashboard of the data.
